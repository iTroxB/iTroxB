To this day in the cybersecurity field (both freelance and professionally), I have performed activities such as:

- 🪲 Collecting large amounts of data along with vulnerability detection in pentesting exercises and bug bounty programs.

- 💻 I led a team in the implementation and development of a blackbox penetration test on a Spanish website.

- 📧 Development and implementation of ethical phishing campaigns for analysis and customer awareness purposes, as well as research in response to malicious phishing and smishing campaigns.

- 📝 Documentation of technical and executive reports, phishing and OSINT reports, confidentiality agreements and rules of engagement.

- 🕵️ Use of the Deepweb and Darkweb to analyze and collect sensitive and exposed information from companies, individuals and criminal groups (this point specifically as part of the development of the Malware Analysis module of the master's degree taken).

- 👤 Creation and use of sock puppets for social engineering testing exercises.
